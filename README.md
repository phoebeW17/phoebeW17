- 👋 Hi, I’m @phoebeW17
- 👀 I’m interested in creating projects that bring value and joy to users! But also adding too many books to my tbr pile... 
- 🌱 I’ve completed the 16 week full stack development course run by Code Institute - Feb 2025. 
- 🪐 Fun fact: Phoebe is a moon that is orbiting Saturn, sadly it is being hit by space debris and disintergrating , creating another ring around Saturn!
